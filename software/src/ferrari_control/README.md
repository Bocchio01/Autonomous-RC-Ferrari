# Ferrari Control Package

The control package stands as a middleware between the `ferrari_planning` | `ferrari_human_machine_interface` and the `ferrari_vehicle_interface` packages.

The package is responsible for computing the required control commands that achieve the desired trajectory generated by the planning package.
Depending on the selected control mode (set by the user through the HMI), the control package will select the appropriate control command to be sent to the robot.
